*Note:* We recently became aware of an issue where a modified version of our game under a domain bearing a similar name was being used for adware. That website is in *no way* affiliated with us â€” Please only use the official link when playing the game! (In the meantime, we've issued a takedown notice to Google).

About the Game
-----------------
Swap is a new take on the classic tile-based puzzle game.

*Change* which character you're controlling to reach your goal -- but be careful, as characters you're not controlling will often have a mind of their own! Progress through a multitude of tricky and challenging levels, and watch as that death count piles up. If you're stuck, you can always hit the 'skip' button to move on, or the 'reset' button to start the level over.

Swap is written in Javascript using the HTML 5 canvas for rendering. It is playable in the browser [here](http://nmoroze.github.io/swap), and is working in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. 

Enjoy!

Controls (now with VIM keybindings!)
-----------------
WASD/arrow keys/vim hjkl - move your character  
Space - switch to another character
